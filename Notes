            <strong>Q: Explain the types of sequential circuits with diagrams. Differentiate between Moore and Mealy machines.</strong>
            <p>Sequential circuits are broadly classified into two types based on how they handle clock signals:</p>
            <p><b>1. Synchronous Sequential Circuits:</b> These circuits use a clock signal to control when the state of the memory elements can change. All state changes happen simultaneously on the active edge of the clock pulse. They are slower but easier to design and are resistant to timing issues.</p>
            <p><b>2. Asynchronous Sequential Circuits:</b> These circuits do not use a clock signal. The state of the circuit can change at any time in response to a change in the inputs. They are faster but are very difficult to design and can have stability problems like races and hazards.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Synchronous sequential circuits are further classified as <b>Moore</b> and <b>Mealy</b> machines:</p>
            
            <p><b>Moore Machine:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The output depends <b>only on the present state</b> of the flip-flops.</li>
                <li>Changes in input affect the output only after the next clock edge changes the state.</li>

        <div class="question">
            <strong>Q: What is a latch?</strong>
            <p>A latch is a basic memory element that can store one bit of information (0 or 1). It is a bistable multivibrator, meaning it has two stable states. It is <b>level-triggered</b>, meaning its output changes as long as the enable signal is active (e.g., HIGH).</p>

        <div class="question">
            <strong>Q: What is the main difference between a latch and a flip-flop?</strong>
            <p>The main difference is their triggering mechanism. A <b>latch is level-triggered</b> (sensitive to the logic level of the control signal), while a <b>flip-flop is edge-triggered</b> (sensitive to the changing edge, either positive or negative, of the clock signal). ‚è∞</p>

            <strong>Q: Explain the D Flip-Flop with its logic diagram and truth table.</strong>
            <p>The D Flip-Flop (Data or Delay Flip-Flop) has one data input (D) and a clock input. It is used to store the value on the data line. It can be made from an SR flip-flop by connecting D to S and an inverted D to R.</p>

            <p><b>Race-Around Condition in JK Flip-Flop:</b></p>
            <p>This problem occurs in level-triggered JK flip-flops. When J=1, K=1, and the clock is HIGH, the output toggles continuously. This happens because the output keeps changing, and this changed output is fed back to the input while the clock is still HIGH. The output might toggle multiple times within one clock pulse, making the final state unpredictable. üòµ</p>
            <p><b>Solution:</b> The race-around condition is eliminated by using <b>edge-triggered flip-flops</b> or a <b>Master-Slave JK flip-flop</b>. The master-slave configuration uses two cascaded latches (one master, one slave) that are triggered on opposite clock levels, ensuring the output changes only once per clock cycle.</p>

            <strong>Q: What is a Johnson Counter?</strong>
            <p>A Johnson Counter, also called a "twisted ring counter," is a modified ring counter where the <b>inverted output</b> (Q') of the last flip-flop is connected to the input of the first. For N flip-flops, it has <b>2N states</b>.</p>

            <strong>Q: Explain the working of a 4-bit Ring Counter with its state table.</strong>
            <p>A 4-bit Ring Counter consists of four flip-flops (e.g., D-type) connected in series. The Q output of the last flip-flop (Q3) is fed back to the D input of the first flip-flop (D0).</p>

            <p>To start, it's pre-loaded with a pattern, typically '1000'. With each clock pulse, the '1' bit shifts one position to the right. After 4 pulses, it returns to the start.</p>

            <strong>Q: Compare Ring and Johnson counters. Explain a 4-bit Johnson counter with its state diagram and timing diagram.</strong>
            <p>Here is a comparison between Ring and Johnson counters:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Feedback:</b> In a Ring counter, the <b>Q output</b> of the last flip-flop connects to the first. In a Johnson counter, the <b>inverted Q' output</b> connects to the first.</li>
                <li><b>Number of States:</b> For N flip-flops, a Ring counter has <b>N states</b>. A Johnson counter has <b>2N states</b>, making it more efficient.</li>
                <li><b>Starting State:</b> A Ring counter needs to be pre-loaded with a specific pattern (like 1000). A Johnson counter can start from the all-zeros state (0000).</li>
                <li><b>Decoding Logic:</b> A Ring counter has simple decoding logic (one state per flip-flop output), but a Johnson counter requires two-input AND gates for decoding its states.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <p><b>4-Bit Johnson Counter Working:</b></p>
            <p>It uses four flip-flops. The inverted output of the last stage (Q3') is connected to the input of the first stage (D0).</p>

            <strong>Q: What is an instruction format?</strong>
            <p>An instruction format defines the layout of the bits of an instruction. It specifies how the different parts of the instruction, such as the <b>opcode</b> (what to do) and the <b>operands</b> (what to do it with), are arranged. üìú</p>

            <strong>Q: Explain the basic components of an instruction.</strong>
            <p>A computer instruction typically consists of three main fields:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Mode Field:</b> This field specifies how the operand or the effective address of the operand is to be determined. It defines the addressing mode (e.g., immediate, direct, indirect).</li>
                <li><b>Opcode (Operation Code) Field:</b> This is the most important part. It specifies the operation to be performed, such as ADD, SUBTRACT, LOAD, or STORE.</li>
                <li><b>Operand Field:</b> This field contains the operand itself or the address of the operand. The operand is the data on which the operation is performed. An instruction can have zero, one, or more operands.</li>
