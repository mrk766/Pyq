    <h2>10-Mark Questions</h2>
    <h3>1. What do you mean by business correspondence? What are the different types of business correspondence?</h3>
    <p><strong>Business correspondence</strong> refers to the formal written communication between organizations, or between an organization and its various stakeholders like customers, suppliers, investors, and government bodies. It is a critical tool for conducting business, building professional relationships, and maintaining an official record of all transactions and discussions. Effective business correspondence must be clear, concise, courteous, correct, and complete to achieve its purpose and uphold the company's reputation.</p>
    <p>The different types of business correspondence can be broadly classified as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Enquiry and Reply Letters:</strong> An enquiry letter is written by a potential buyer to a seller to request information about goods, services, prices, or terms. A reply letter provides the requested information and aims to convert the enquiry into a sale.</li>
      <li><strong>Order Letters:</strong> This is a formal letter sent by a buyer to a seller to place an order for goods. It must be precise, containing all necessary details like item description, quantity, quality, price, delivery address, and payment method.</li>
      <li><strong>Complaint and Adjustment Letters:</strong> A complaint letter is written by a customer to express dissatisfaction with a product or service. An adjustment letter is the reply, which aims to resolve the issue amicably by offering an apology, an explanation, and a solution (like a replacement or refund).</li>
      <li><strong>Sales Correspondence:</strong> This includes letters written with the primary objective of promoting and selling products. Examples are sales circulars, promotional offers, and follow-up letters to prospective customers.</li>
      <li><strong>Collection Letters:</strong> These are a series of letters sent by a seller to a customer to remind them of their overdue payments. The tone of these letters progresses from a gentle reminder to a more firm request for payment.</li>
      <li><strong>Circular Letters:</strong> A circular is a letter designed to convey the same information to a large number of people simultaneously, such as announcing a new product, a change of address, or a new policy.</li>
      <li><strong>Internal Correspondence (Memos):</strong> Memorandums or memos are used for communication within an organization. They are less formal than external letters and are used for making announcements, giving instructions, or reporting on activities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Write a note on sole proprietorship. Explain its features and limitations.</h3>
    <p>A <strong>sole proprietorship</strong> is the simplest and oldest form of business organization, where a single individual owns, manages, and controls the entire business. From a legal standpoint, the business is not a separate entity from its owner. This means the owner is entitled to all the profits generated by the business but is also personally responsible for all of its debts and liabilities. It is the most popular business structure for small businesses, startups, and self-employed professionals due to its ease of formation and minimal regulatory burden.</p>
    <p><strong>Features of Sole Proprietorship:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Single Ownership and Control:</strong> The business is owned and controlled by one person, who has the final say in all decisions. This allows for quick and flexible decision-making.</li>
      <li><strong>No Separate Legal Entity:</strong> The law does not distinguish between the owner and the business. All contracts and business obligations are made in the owner's name.</li>
      <li><strong>Unlimited Liability:</strong> This is the most significant feature. If the business assets are insufficient to cover its debts, the owner's personal assets (like their home, car, or savings) can be legally seized to pay off the creditors.</li>
      <li><strong>Easy Formation and Closure:</strong> There are very few legal formalities or expenses involved in starting or closing a sole proprietorship. In many cases, it requires no formal registration.</li>
      <li><strong>Sole Beneficiary of Profits:</strong> The owner receives 100% of the profits and is not required to share them with anyone. This provides a strong incentive to work hard.</li>
      <li><strong>Secrecy:</strong> The proprietor is not legally required to publish the business's financial accounts, allowing for complete confidentiality in business operations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Limitations of Sole Proprietorship:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Limited Financial Resources:</strong> The capital is limited to the owner’s personal savings and their ability to borrow money, which restricts the potential for significant growth and expansion.</li>
      <li><strong>Unlimited Liability:</strong> This is a major drawback, as it exposes the owner to significant personal financial risk. A business failure can lead to personal bankruptcy.</li>
      <li><strong>Limited Managerial Ability:</strong> One person cannot be an expert in all aspects of management (e.g., marketing, finance, production). This can lead to inefficient decision-making.</li>
      <li><strong>Lack of Continuity:</strong> The business's existence is entirely dependent on the owner. The death, illness, or retirement of the owner often leads to the closure of the business, making its lifespan uncertain.</li>
    </ul>
